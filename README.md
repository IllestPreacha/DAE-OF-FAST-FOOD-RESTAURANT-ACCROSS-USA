# DAE-OF-FAST-FOOD-RESTAURANT-ACCROSS-USA
In this Data Analysis and Exploration we're using the list of over 10,000 Fast Food restaurants provided by Datafiniti's Business Database. The dataset includes the restaurant's address, city, latitude and longitude coordinates, name, and more. Note that this is a sample of a large dataset The dataset contains 8 Columns and 10000 rows, the columns are mostly of Categorical variables except for longitude and latitude columns which are Continuous variables.  See that the Dataset did not come with a Land Area Column I have decided to bring in another Dataset that has Land Area data and join it to our original Dataset this will help us to determine which state has the most Fast Food per meter or mile square.
